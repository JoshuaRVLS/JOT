// total instead -- features/wakatime.h is that other source).
//
// This is the fallback that makes the number worth showing with the integration
// off: the totals are stored per workspace and day, so opening the editor again
// later today continues the total instead of restarting a timer nobody reads.
//
// What counts is the rule every coding-time tracker uses, and it is the
// difference between a useful number and a broken one: time is credited between
// two activity ticks, and any gap longer than the cap is dropped, so an editor
// left open overnight does not log eight hours of nothing.
//
// Split so both halves are testable without a clock: `credit_for` is the rule,
// and `Counter` is the rule plus its two readings (the committed total and the
// moment the last credit was taken).
