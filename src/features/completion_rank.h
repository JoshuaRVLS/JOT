// Ranking the completion popup by what this user actually picks and by what the
// file being edited is already about.
//
// The editor cannot learn from a corpus the way IntelliCode does, but the two
// signals that make a suggestion feel smart are local and cheap: the names the
// user accepts often (a habit, kept per language and persisted) and the names
// already written near the caret (the context of the edit). Both fold into one
// number here, in points the popup adds to its own score.
//
// Everything in this namespace is pure: text in, numbers out, no buffer and no
// server, so a case can rank a list without an editor. The load and save at the
// bottom are the only I/O, and they take their path as an argument.

  // A count fades. What the user reached for every day last month should not
  // still outrank what they are reaching for now, so every use is stamped and a
  // count is halved for each half-life that passes (`decay`). The stamp is the
  // moment the count was last brought up to date rather than the moment of the
  // use, which is what makes a run of decays equal to one decay of the whole age:
  // the count keeps its fraction, so no time is lost rounding it down.
