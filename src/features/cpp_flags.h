// The flags clangd needs to judge C and C++ code.
//
// A language server without the project's compile flags parses every file with
// the compiler's own default standard, and on modern code that reads as broken
// rather than as "not configured": a `requires` clause is a missing ';', a
// concept name is an unknown type, `<=>` is a bad operator. The errors land on
// lines that hold no mistake at all.
//
// clangd looks for a compile_commands.json beside the sources and in the
// directories above them. These helpers cover the two cases that leaves:
//
//   * the database is in the build directory (`build/compile_commands.json`,
//     which is what CMake writes and what most projects never copy to the
//     root), and clangd does not look there, and
//   * there is no database anywhere -- a folder of sources, a checkout before
//     the first configure -- where the standard has to come from somewhere.
