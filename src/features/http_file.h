// The `.http` / `.rest` request files -- the HTTP-client syntax IntelliJ
// invented and rest.nvim brought to editors -- parsed, resolved and executed
// here, with the editor side (jot/app/rest_client.cpp) only feeding a buffer in
// and painting a buffer out.
//
// Everything in this header is pure text work so it can be pinned by tests:
//
//   * parse() reads one file into its `@var = value` declarations and its
//     requests. Requests are separated by `###` lines (the trailing text names
//     the request below it) or named by a `# @name foo` comment. A request is
//     `METHOD URL`, optional `Key: value` headers (query lines starting with
//     `?` or `&` keep appending to the URL), a blank line, then the body -- or
//     a single `< ./file.json` line, which takes the body from that file.
//   * resolve() substitutes `{{name}}` in the URL, headers and body: the
//     file's own `@vars` first (each value may itself reference other vars),
//     then the dynamic `{{$uuid}}` / `{{$timestamp}}` / `{{$datetime}}` /
//     `{{$randomInt}}`, then the process environment. A name that resolves to
//     nothing is left as written and reported, never silently blanked.
//   * build_curl_command() turns a resolved request into one shell command;
//   * parse_response() reads curl's output back (headers, body and the
//     `--write-out` trailer that carries status, time and size);
//   * format_response() renders the result as the response tab's lines, with
//     the body pretty-printed when it is JSON (the common case) and the
//     metadata prefixed `//` so the JSON ruleset colours it as a comment.
//
// Redirects are deliberately *not* followed (no `--location`): the response
// shown is the one the server actually returned, with its `Location` header
// visible, instead of a chain curl walked behind the user's back.
