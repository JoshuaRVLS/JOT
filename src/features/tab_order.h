// The workspace's buffer order -- what the tab strip shows, in the order it
// shows it.
//
// Buffers live in a vector that is erased from the middle (`close_buffer_at`),
// so a buffer's index is not its identity and every index goes stale the moment
// a tab closes to its left. The order therefore refers to buffers by *uid*: a
// `FileBuffer::tab_uid`, handed out on first sight and carried by the buffer for
// as long as it lives (barbar.nvim's "buffer number" role, minus the renaming).
//
// The model is fed the live buffer vector and reconciles: uids it has never
// seen are placed according to the insert policy, uids whose buffer is gone are
// dropped, and the order stays a list of live buffers only. Reconciling rather
// than being told about every open/close keeps the one call site honest
// (`Editor::sync_tab_order`) instead of trusting eight different `push_back`s.
//
