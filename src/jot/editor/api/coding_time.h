// One chip reports how long was coded today in the workspace in front of the
// user, and two sources can answer for it: WakaTime's own total for today, read
// out of wakatime-cli (features/wakatime.h), or the local store kept beside the
// config (features/coding_time.h) for when the integration is off, has not
// answered, or has no account to answer with. The Extensions category in
// :settings is where WakaTime is turned on; the local store runs either way,
// because it is what the chip falls back to.
//
// The cli is never downloaded. A missing one is reported on the message line,
// because an editor that silently installs a binary behind the user's back is a
// worse neighbour than one that says what is missing.
//
// This file is jot/app/coding_time.cpp -- the two sources share the ticks the
// editor hands out (a keypress, a save, a file switch, and the frame loop's
// once-a-second pass), which is why they share a module.

// The single entry point the editor's hooks use: a keypress, a save, a file

// with WakaTime off it is what the chip reports -- it has to have been
// counting all along for the fallback to mean anything.
