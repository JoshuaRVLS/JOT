// The workspace scan behind `:cppcheck` and the Problems list: every header and
// source in the workspace is parsed for function signatures, and
// a declaration with no body anywhere -- or a signature with more than one body
// -- becomes a diagnostic (see features/cpp_definitions.h for the rules).
//
// The scan runs on the worker thread, once per workspace (on open, on save, when
// an unsaved buffer's signatures change, and when asked); its result lands as one
// diagnostics slice per file, which the LSP merge and every diagnostics surface
// then read exactly like a server's.

// A fragment of the Editor class body, included by src/jot/editor.h. It is not
// a standalone header: no include guard, no includes, and the members sit in
// class scope exactly as if they were written in editor.h.
