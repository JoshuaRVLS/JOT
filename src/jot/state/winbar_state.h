//
// The model it presents lives in features/winbar.h (where crumbs come from and
// what a crumb's menu offers); this is the state around it: the setting, the
// symbol cache the chain is built from, and the open menu.
//
// The menu is a *cascade*, dropbar's model: level 0 is the crumb's own siblings
// -- a folder's children, a file's folder, the symbols sharing a scope -- and
// every level below it is a folder opened from the selected row of the level
// above, whose `parent_entry` keeps pointing at it. Each level carries its own
// rows, selection, scroll and rect, so a deeper panel is hit-tested where it is
// drawn and the level a key acts on is the one it was opened from.
//
// Split out of editor_state.h (the umbrella over src/jot/state/), like the
// other domain groups.
