"""Probe: the bundled AI assistant stays unregistered while it is disabled.

The AI runtime is loaded from src/jot/lua/api_bindings.cpp, and every surface it
owns - the command palette's rows, the :CodeCompanion* commands and the
Alt+Shift+A keymap family - is registered by features/ai/init.lua. Skipping the
load has to leave all of them absent, because a surface that still answers would
make "disabled" only half true.

Scenes, all against the real binary:
  * the palette lists no CodeCompanion* command for its query;
  * running :CodeCompanionChat never opens the chat buffer;
  * Alt+Shift+A C never opens it either (the family is gone).

Usage: test/ai_disabled_probe.py [path-to-jot] [--dump]
Exit codes: 0 pass, 1 fail, 2 skipped (no binary).
