"""Probe: Alt chords are live wherever the focus sits, and only type when they are text.

Alt chords are shortcuts, so the interesting question is not whether the terminal
delivers them -- it does, as `ESC <letter>` on a plain terminal and as a kitty
CSI-u report on one that speaks the protocol, and both decode to the same
modifier bit -- but whether the editor still acts on them once the focus has left
the buffer. It used to not, in two places:

  * the file explorer, which is exactly where `jot <folder>` starts and where a
    click on any file in the tree leaves the focus. Alt+W and Alt+N were dropped
    there while Ctrl chords were routed through, so Alt looked broken in a way
    that pointed at the terminal;
  * the Problems panel, which returned "handled" for every key, so Ctrl+S and
    every Alt chord did nothing while its list had focus.

Both encodings are exercised for one of the chords: a probe that only spoke
CSI-u would pass on a terminal the editor never asked for.

Usage: test/alt_chords_probe.py [path-to-jot]
Exit codes: 0 pass, 1 fail, 2 skipped (no binary).
