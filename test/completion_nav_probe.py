"""End-to-end check: Up/Down move the completion popup's selected row.

The popup's list is rebuilt on every frame from the word under the caret, and
the selection used to be re-derived from the selected row's *label* during that
rebuild. A server's overloads share one label -- clangd answers `incl` with a
family of `std::includes` rows, all labeled "std::includes" -- so the rebuild
snapped the selection back to the family's first row before the frame was even
painted: every Down moved the highlight for a moment and the next frame put it
back, and the popup could never be browsed past the first overload.

This drives the real binary against the real clangd, types `incl` in a C++
file, and reads the popup's own footer (its "N/total" position counter) and
selection band off the terminal stream -- the two things a user sees move. The
same run also checks the other half: Up walks back. The scenes after that aim
SGR mouse events at the box the popup painted, because the pointer belongs to
the list there: a wheel notch walks it and a press takes the clicked row, both
with the popup staying up until the press takes it (before, either one fell
through to the buffer -- the wheel dismissed the popup, a press moved the caret).

Usage: test/completion_nav_probe.py [path-to-jot-binary]
Exit codes: 0 pass, 1 fail, 2 binary or clangd missing.
