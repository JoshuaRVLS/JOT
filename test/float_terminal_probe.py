"""Probe: the floating terminal (Alt+Shift+T, :termfloat), in a real session.

C++ pins the box's geometry, its painting and its selection against a shell-less
vterm. What only a real session proves is the shell inside the box: that the
chord opens one at the workspace root, that the keys land in the pty, that
Escape hides the box without ending the process, and that the wheel walks the
same shell's scrollback once the box is back.

Three scenes, each its own session (a scene must not inherit another's shell):
  * open: the box appears over the buffer, covering a filler line that was on
    the grid a moment earlier, and leaves the status line alone; `echo FLOAT_OK`
    lands in it and the shell reports the workspace as its directory;
  * hide: Escape removes the box, and the chord brings it back with the same
    shell, which is what FLOAT_OK still being on screen proves;
  * scroll: `seq 1 40` pushes that line out of the box and the wheel over the
    box walks back to it.

Usage: test/float_terminal_probe.py [path-to-jot] [--dump]
Exit codes: 0 pass, 1 fail, 2 skipped (no binary).
