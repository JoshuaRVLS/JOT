"""Probe: wheel scrolling in the GUI glides; it does not kick or teleport.

The GUI slide is pixel animation (ui/gui/gui_anim.cpp), so a terminal screen
cannot show it. This drives the real binary on a private Xvfb display, sends
real wheel notches with XTEST, and reads the window back between frames to
watch the content move.

The landmarks are the diagnostic bands (the full-row background a warning
wears): a scripted `clangd` warns on lines spaced 3, 8, 4, 7, 5 and 6 rows
apart, repeating. Evenly spaced bands are no use here -- the pane repeats
every two notches, so a jump aliases onto a small move. The uneven gaps make
the visible arrangement identify exactly where the content is, and one whole
gap cycle (33 rows, 759 px) is wider than anything a single frame can cover,
which is what lets a teleport show up as a teleport.

Scenes:
  * calibration: three paced notches each move the content the same distance,
    a whole number of rows (the wheel step is proportional),
  * burst: eight notches in quick succession glide in one continuous motion:
    the content never moves backwards (the mid-glide snap this replaced threw
    the rest of the accumulated scroll backwards a whole pane at once), never
    overshoots where it lands, and lands exactly on 8 notches,
  * reversal: notches one way interrupted by notches back land where they
    started, turning around at most once.

Usage: test/gui_scroll_probe.py [path-to-jot] [--dump]
Exit codes: 0 pass, 1 fail, 2 skipped (no binary or no python-xlib).
