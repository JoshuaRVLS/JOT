"""Probe: the home screen, on the rendered screen.

The screen is the way into a project: it lists the folders around the launch
directory, the folder you are in, and it prints on every row the key that opens
it. The ways that goes wrong are all quiet on a unit test of the model -- a key
painted next to one row but dispatched to another, a query that filters the list
but not the rows Enter acts on, a selection band that runs the full width of a
panel much wider than its names -- so the probe drives the real binary and reads
the cells back out of the pty stream:

  * the launch folder is named on the context line and the projects around it
    are listed with a key each,
  * the selection band covers the label and stops, so the key at the far edge
    keeps its own background,
  * typing filters the rows and the query line says what by, without dismissing
    the screen,
  * the first Esc takes the query back, the second closes the screen,
  * the digit a row prints is the digit that opens it,
  * '/' lets a shortcut letter start a query instead of firing,
  * a query and its Enter in one read still open the row the query left, and a
    query that matches nothing opens nothing,
  * a click on a row opens what it names.

Usage: test/home_open_probe.py [path-to-jot] [--dump]
Exit codes: 0 pass, 1 fail, 2 skipped (no binary).
