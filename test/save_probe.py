"""Probe: a real save leaves the bytes the buffer was showing.

The unit rules (src/features/save_hygiene.*) and the write helper
(src/tools/file_util.*) are covered by test_save_hygiene.cpp; this drives the
binary's own save (Ctrl+S in the modeless editing mode) and then reads the file
off disk, because that is where a hygiene rule and the bytes on disk can still
disagree: the buffer is text the editor holds, the file is what the next `git
diff` sees.

Cases:
  * trailing whitespace is dropped, and a missing final newline is not (a file
    that did not end in one is written back with one, as before),
  * the setting off keeps every space,
  * markdown keeps its hard line breaks with the setting on.

Usage: test/save_probe.py [path-to-jot] [--dump]
Exit codes: 0 pass, 1 fail, 2 skipped (no binary).
