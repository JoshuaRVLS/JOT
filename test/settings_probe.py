"""Probe: the settings panel's search bar, sections, steppers and choices drop-down.

The unit tests drive the panel's model headlessly (grouping, filtering,
stepping, the drop-down's cursor). What only a real session proves is the
picture: that the search bar is on screen with a live match count, that typing
lands in it, that the keys are listed under their group's heading, that an int
row wears its nf-fa-minus/plus steppers right where the mouse hit test put
them, that an enum row shows its cycling chevrons, and that Enter opens the
choices as a list that applies what the cursor is on -- with the glyphs the
native layout recorded rather than whatever Lua felt like drawing.

Every scene is its own session (one screen read per run), opening this probe's
workspace and then :settings from the command palette.

Usage: test/settings_probe.py [path-to-jot] [--dump]
Exit codes: 0 pass, 1 fail, 2 skipped (no binary).
