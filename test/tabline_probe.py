"""Probe: the workspace tab strip, on the rendered screen.

The strip is a row the rest of the layout has to agree with, and every way that
agreement can break is quiet: a pane that still keeps a header row of its own
shows a blank line above the code (the strip costs a row *and* the panes spend
one), a hit test reading a different origin than the painter opens the wrong
file, and a key that still means "the focused pane's second tab" picks a tab
that is not the second one on screen. None of that fails a unit test of the
order model: the model has no opinion about rows.

This drives the real binary with three files open and reads the cell rows back
out of the pty stream:

  * row 0 carries the tabs and row 1 is the first code row (no blank chrome row
    between them, and the strip is not inside the pane),
  * Alt+2 picks the second tab *on the strip* and the status line names it,
  * Alt+R arms jump-to-buffer mode and the next letter picks that tab,
  * a click on a tab switches to it.

Usage: test/tabline_probe.py [path-to-jot] [--dump]
Exit codes: 0 pass, 1 fail, 2 skipped (no binary).
