"""Probe: which directory a terminal opened with the editor starts in.

The workspace root is the editor's own answer to "which directory": the explorer
walks it, the debugger launches in it, a plugin job's terminal starts there. A
terminal used to inherit jot's process cwd instead, which is the directory jot
was launched from. Those are the same only when the workspace arrived as an
argument, because main chdirs into it: a workspace resumed with no arguments, or
opened later from the home menu, leaves the process where it was, so the shell
came up outside the workspace.

Three scenes, each read through the shell's own report of its directory
(`echo "cwd:$PWD"`, and `cwd2:` after a restart):
  * resume: a recent workspace is seeded and jot runs with no arguments from a
    different directory, so the two agree only if the terminal followed the
    workspace;
  * argument: jot is given the workspace directory, the case that already
    worked, pinned so the fix cannot trade one scene for another;
  * restart: a resumed workspace again, where the shell is exited and the
    panel is clicked to bring it back, and it must come back where it was
    rather than in the launch directory the fix just removed from that path.

Usage: test/terminal_cwd_probe.py [path-to-jot] [--dump]
Exit codes: 0 pass, 1 fail, 2 skipped (no binary).
