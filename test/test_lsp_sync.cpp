// The document-sync rules between the editor and a language server: what goes
// out on didOpen / didChange / didSave, and which published diagnostics are
// kept. The test seams record the outbound messages instead of writing them to
// a spawned server and feed server messages in through the real parser
// (LSPClient::capture_wire_for_test / receive_for_test).
//
// These rules are the difference between real findings and phantom ones. A
// server's document is only ever updated by didChange -- didSave's `text` is
// informational -- so a save that skips a change leaves the server parsing a
// stale draft and reporting errors at lines the user already fixed. And a
// publish discarded for being a version behind is not necessarily stale: the
// server may have coalesced its parses, making it the freshest word there is.
