"""Probe: typing does not put a copy of the buffer on the undo stack.

An undo snapshot holds the text a command is about to change, and the history
keeps 500 of them. A snapshot used to copy every line of the buffer, so one
keystroke in a 2000-line file cost ~190 KB and the history grew to ~94 MB (the
cap) while it was typed into. Snapshots now share the lines they did not change
with the snapshot underneath, which puts the same keystroke at one pointer per
line (~32 KB).

This drives the real binary, types into a 2000-line file and reads the
process's own RSS around it. Two scenes: the growth per keystroke has to stay
under half of what a per-keystroke copy would cost, and an undo after typing
has to put the text back, which is what tells the sharing never aliased the
live buffer.

Usage: test/undo_memory_probe.py [path-to-jot] [--dump]
Exit codes: 0 pass, 1 fail, 2 skipped (no binary, no /proc).
