"""Probe: the WakaTime integration, against stub wakatime-cli, curl and unzip.

The integration's whole contract is with wakatime-cli: the editor spawns it and
reads what it prints. So the probe puts a stub `wakatime-cli` first on PATH that
appends the argv it was handed to a file, and answers `--today` with a fixed
payload. What the editor actually asked for is then read back from the file the
stub wrote -- the production path (the worker queue, the shell, the plugin spec's
rule), not a seam.

The editor installs that cli when PATH has none, and the install is a curl and an
unpack: the probe stubs those too, as two more PATH entries that write down what
they were handed. The stub unzip unpacks the file the stub curl "downloaded"
using the release's real layout (one binary named after the asset, .exe on
Windows), so a wrong asset or a wrong inner name in the editor fails here rather
than on a user's machine.

Scenes:

  * an edit and a save put two heartbeats in the record, from the cli on PATH --
    the first without `--write`, the second with it and on the absolute path of
    the file in the buffer. The spec's rule is what keeps it at two and not one
    per keystroke -- and nothing is downloaded, because PATH already had one;
  * the record holds a `--today --output json` run, and the bar shows the total
    the stub answered with -- so the fetch, the parse and the chip are one
    chain, on a real screen;
  * with no cli on PATH the install runs against the stub curl/unzip: this
    machine's release asset is fetched and unpacked into
    $WAKATIME_HOME/.wakatime/wakatime-cli, and every run after that comes from
    that absolute path;
  * a copy already in the WakaTime home is used as it is, with no second
    download;
  * an install that cannot download is reported once and leaves the chip on the
    local total, with nothing spawned;
  * with `wakatime=false` nothing is spawned and nothing is installed.

Usage: test/wakatime_probe.py [path-to-jot] [--dump]
Exit codes: 0 pass, 1 fail, 2 skipped (no binary).
