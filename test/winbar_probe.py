"""Probe: the breadcrumb winbar, on the rendered screen.

The row is chrome the rest of the layout has to agree with, and the ways that
agreement can break are quiet: a pane that keeps a *blank* chrome row while the
breadcrumb paints somewhere else pushes the code down for nothing, a hit test
reading a different origin than the painter opens the wrong crumb's menu, and a
menu whose rows do not line up with the pointer picks a file nobody clicked.
None of that fails a unit test of the chain model: the model has no opinion
about cells.

This drives the real binary with a small C++ workspace and reads the cell rows
back out of the pty stream:

  * row 0 is the tab strip, row 1 is the pane's breadcrumb
    (root / folders / file), row 2 is the file's first line of code,
  * moving the caret into a symbol adds that symbol to the row,
  * a click on the file crumb opens its menu over the folder's other files,
  * a click on a row of that menu opens the file it names,
  * Esc, a press outside the menu and a press on its own crumb all take the
    menu off the screen -- it is a Lua float, so a state that closes without
    telling the handler leaves the panel painted with nothing behind it,
  * a folder row wears a chevron and opens its own panel *beside* the level
    that offered it (the cascade), and a row in that panel opens its file,
  * `winbar=off` gives the row back to the code.

Usage: test/winbar_probe.py [path-to-jot] [--dump]
Exit codes: 0 pass, 1 fail, 2 skipped (no binary).
