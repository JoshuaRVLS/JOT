"""Probe: every pane of a split paints its own breadcrumb row.

The breadcrumb winbar is one Lua surface for the whole split: the native side
hands it every pane's row in one payload. It used to be keyed on a single row,
so each pane's emit re-configured the same float and the pane that emitted last
owned it -- a stacked split showed a breadcrumb above the lower pane and an
empty band above the upper one, which still paid for the row.

This drives the real binary, splits the pane, and reads both rows back off the
screen. The unit cases cover the layout and the Lua painter separately; only
this sees the two together.

Usage: test/winbar_split_probe.py [path-to-jot] [--dump]
Exit codes: 0 pass, 1 fail, 2 skipped (no binary).
